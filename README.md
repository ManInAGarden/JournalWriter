# JournalWriter
Journal Writer ist what it's name says. I use it for writing a daily Journal. It uses markup.

Wehn you start JournalWriter it creates a file (edit it's path in the JournalWriter.exe.config) for your daily journal and 
adds room for the first day. Double click int o the editor windows on the right and edit your text.
